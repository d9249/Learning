Numerous variations of the Kellgren and Lawrence classification system have been used in research 3. Below is the original description 1-3:

grade 0 (none): definite absence of x-ray changes of osteoarthritis

grade 1 (doubtful): doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping

grade 2 (minimal): definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing

grade 3 (moderate): moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space and some sclerosis and possible deformity of bone ends

grade 4 (severe): large osteophytes, marked narrowing of joint space, severe sclerosis and definite deformity of bone ends

Osteoarthritis is deemed present at grade 2 although of minimal severity 1.
